# Tutorials for BrainEx and NAML
This repository contains tutorials for BrainEx and NAML - two tools created and used by WPI's HCI Lab. These tutorials are meant to serve as an introduction for users new to these tools. Also included are guides on how to install NAML and BrainEx. 

*Note: Many of the BrainEx tutorials use Jupyter Notebook to create an interactive experience. If you are unfamiliar with this system I would suggest first looking at the "AGuideToJupyterNotebooks" file.*
